## 🏆 Notebook 1: REE Market Leaders (90 seconds)

### **Demo Script:**
1. **Open**: `01_REE_Ranking_Applicants_ENHANCED.ipynb`
2. **Run first cell** - Show PATSTAT connection
3. **Skip to market intelligence cell** (pre-run setup cells)
4. **Live code this enhancement:**

```python
# 💡 Claude Code Live Enhancement
print("Adding market intelligence with Claude Code...")

# Calculate market share and competitive positioning
df['Market_Share_Pct'] = (df['Patent_Families'] / df['Patent_Families'].sum() * 100).round(2)
df['Portfolio_Classification'] = pd.cut(df['Patent_Families'], 
                                       bins=[0, 5, 20, 50, float('inf')],
                                       labels=['Emerging', 'Active', 'Major', 'Dominant'])

# Show results
print(f"🏆 Market Leader: {df.iloc[0]['Applicant']}")
print(f"📊 Market Share: {df.iloc[0]['Market_Share_Pct']}%")
print(f"🌍 Geographic Insight: Chinese institutions dominate")
```

5. **Run dashboard creation cell** - Show interactive visualization
6. **Highlight business value**: "4,313 patent families, market concentration analysis"

### **Key Talking Points:**
- "From Riccardo's ranking to strategic intelligence in 60 seconds"
- "Chinese dominance clearly visible - strategic implications"
- "Interactive dashboard ready for board presentations"

### **Recovery Prompts:**
- If PATSTAT fails: "This demonstrates real-world conditions - let's continue with cached data"
- If visualization issues: "Let me show you the data intelligence instead"
- If slow query: "This demonstrates real-time PATSTAT processing"

## 🌍 Notebook 2: Geographic Intelligence (90 seconds)

### **Demo Script:**
1. **Open**: `02_REE_Family_Size_Geographic_ENHANCED.ipynb`
2. **Run to geographic enhancement cell**
3. **Live code this enhancement:**

```python
# 💡 Claude Code Geographic Intelligence
print("Adding global patent strategy intelligence...")

# Strategic classification based on family size
geo_analysis['filing_strategy'] = pd.cut(
    geo_analysis['avg_family_size'],
    bins=[0, 2, 5, 10, float('inf')],
    labels=['Domestic Focus', 'Regional Strategy', 'Global Strategy', 'Premium Global']
)

# Show strategic insights
strategy_dist = geo_analysis['filing_strategy'].value_counts()
print("🌍 Global Filing Strategies:")
for strategy, count in strategy_dist.items():
    print(f"  • {strategy}: {count} instances")
```

4. **Show world map visualization**
5. **Highlight geographic insights**: "Family size reveals international strategy"

### **Key Talking Points:**
- "Family size = international filing strategy"
- "Larger families = more valuable patents = global market focus"
- "Geographic intelligence for competitive analysis"

## 🕸️ Notebook 3: Technology Network (90 seconds)

### **Demo Script:**
1. **Open**: `03_REE_Technology_Network_ENHANCED.ipynb`
2. **Run to network enhancement cell**
3. **Live code this enhancement:**

```python
# 💡 Claude Code Network Intelligence
print("Discovering technology convergence patterns...")

# Identify cross-domain innovations
strong_connections['is_cross_domain'] = (
    strong_connections['domain_1'] != strong_connections['domain_2']
)

cross_domain_pct = strong_connections['is_cross_domain'].mean() * 100
print(f"🔀 Cross-domain innovations: {cross_domain_pct:.1f}%")

# Show top innovation pathways
top_pathways = strong_connections.nlargest(5, 'total_co_occurrences')
print("🚀 Top Innovation Pathways:")
for _, pathway in top_pathways.iterrows():
    indicator = "🔀" if pathway['is_cross_domain'] else "📍"
    print(f"  {indicator} {pathway['IPC_1']} ↔ {pathway['IPC_2']}")
```

4. **Show network visualization**
5. **Highlight innovation insights**: "Technology convergence reveals future trends"

### **Key Talking Points:**
- "Technology co-occurrence reveals innovation pathways"
- "Cross-domain connections = breakthrough potential"
- "Network analysis shows where industries converge"
