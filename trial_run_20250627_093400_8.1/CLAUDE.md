## Key Technical Integrations

### Connect to Existing Pipeline Results
```python
# Use results from your existing integrated_pipeline.py
def integrate_market_intelligence():
    """
    Step 1: Run existing REE patent analysis
    Step 2: Add USGS market data layer  
    Step 3: Generate correlation insights
    """
    
    # Your existing working code:
    existing_results = run_complete_ree_analysis(test_mode=False)
    
    # NEW: Add market intelligence layer
    market_correlator = PatentMarketCorrelator(existing_results)
    market_insights = market_correlator.analyze_price_shock_patent_response()
    
    # NEW: Enhanced reporting
    business_intel = REEBusinessIntelligence()
    consulting_reports = business_intel.generate_sme_risk_assessment()
    
    return {
        'patent_analysis': existing_results,  # Your working system
        'market_intelligence': market_insights,  # NEW addition  
        'business_reports': consulting_reports   # NEW consulting deliverables
    }
```

### Specific USGS Data Integration Points

## Key Technical Specifications

### PATSTAT Citation Architecture
**Critical Discovery**: Citations work via publications, not direct application IDs
```python
# CORRECT APPROACH - Via Publication Linkage
def get_forward_citations(db, ree_appln_ids):
    # Step 1: Get publication IDs for REE applications
    ree_publications = get_publications_for_applications(appln_ids)
    
    # Step 2: Find citations via publication linkage  
    forward_query = """
    SELECT c.*, citing_info.*
    FROM tls212_citation c
    JOIN tls211_pat_publn p_citing ON c.pat_publn_id = p_citing.pat_publn_id
    WHERE c.cited_pat_publn_id IN (ree_publication_ids)
    """
```
